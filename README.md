# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim: To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

### AI Tools Required: 

# Explanation: 
Define the Two Prompt Types:

Write a basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.
Based on that pattern type refined the prompt and submit that with AI tool.
Get the ouput and write the report.

Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:
Select various scenarios such as:
Generating a creative story.
Answering a factual question.
Summarizing an article or concept.
Providing advice or recommendations.
Or Any other test scenario
For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.
Run Experiments with ChatGPT:
Input the naïve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.
Evaluate Responses : 
	Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?
Deliverables:
A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to naïve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT’s outputs.
Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.

# Study of Prompt Templating Techniques for Automated Maintenance Report Generation

---

## 1. Introduction

Maintenance reports are essential for documenting the operational status, performance, and servicing of industrial equipment. Traditionally, these reports are handwritten or typed manually, which can lead to **errors, delays, and inconsistencies**.

With the rapid development of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, automated report generation has emerged as a solution. The use of **prompt templating techniques** plays a central role in guiding AI systems to create structured and meaningful outputs.

In this study, we analyze different **prompt patterns** for automated maintenance reporting:

- Instructional Pattern  
- Comparison Pattern  
- Command Pattern  
- Q&A Pattern  

These are evaluated for their **suitability, advantages, and limitations** in real-world maintenance tasks.

## 2. What is Prompt Templating?

Prompt templating is the process of **designing structured prompts** with placeholders, guiding AI to produce **predictable and accurate outputs**. Instead of open-ended queries, templates impose a **controlled framework**.

### Example Template for Maintenance Reporting

Generate a maintenance report with the following details:
- Machine ID: [MACHINE_ID]
- Date: [DATE]
- Issue Observed: [ISSUE]
- Actions Taken: [ACTIONS]
- Recommendations: [RECOMMENDATION]
- Next Scheduled Maintenance: [NEXT_DATE]

This ensures consistency and professionalism in reporting.

## 3. Instructional Prompt Pattern

The **Instructional Pattern** involves giving the AI **explicit, step-by-step instructions**.

### Key Features

* Clear, direct, and structured.
* Uses placeholders for data.
* Produces predictable, task-oriented outputs.

### Maintenance Example

Write a maintenance report for Machine [ID].
Include: observed issue, corrective actions taken, recommendation, and next scheduled maintenance date.

### Sample Workflow

Step | Process       | Example
---- | ------------- | ---------------------------------
1    | Data Input    | Technician enters machine details
2    | Template Use  | Instructional format applied
3    | AI Processing | Report is generated
4    | Output        | Structured report
5    | Verification  | Supervisor reviews

### Workflow Diagram

    D --> E[Verification]

### Advantages

* Consistency in reports
* Fast generation (<1 min per report)
* Low error rate
* Easy to scale

---

## 4. Comparison Prompt Pattern

The **Comparison Pattern** is useful when analyzing or contrasting different datasets, such as machine performance over time.

### Key Features

* Highlights differences and similarities.
* Useful for diagnostics and performance tracking.
* Encourages analytical outputs.

### Maintenance Example

Compare the maintenance status of Machine A and Machine B.
Highlight: issues observed, frequency of repairs, and next service date.

### Sample Output Table

Machine | Issues in Last 6 Months | Repair Frequency | Next Service
------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------
A       | Overheating, Oil Leak   | 4 times          | 15-Sep-2025
B       | Motor Noise             | 2 times          | 20-Sep-2025

### Advantages

* Enables trend analysis
* Simplifies decision-making
* Good for fleet-wide maintenance

---

## 5. Command Prompt Pattern

The **Command Pattern** involves short, directive instructions given to the AI.

### Key Features

* Concise and action-oriented.
* Minimal phrasing, direct execution.
* Best for quick, repetitive tasks.

### Maintenance Example

Generate a one-page maintenance report for Machine X on [DATE].

### Advantages

* Fastest pattern (seconds to generate).
* Ideal for technicians with limited input time.
* Works well for standardized reports.

### Limitations

* May miss details if not explicitly included.
* Requires structured input data.

---

## 6. Q&A Prompt Pattern

The **Q&A Pattern** simulates a **question–answer** interaction between technician and system.

### Key Features

* Interactive and conversational.
* Ensures no missing details.
* Technician fills answers step by step.

### Maintenance Example

Q: What is the Machine ID?  
A: 1024-B  

Q: What issue was observed?  
A: Bearing failure  

Q: What corrective action was taken?  
A: Bearing replaced, lubrication applied  

Q: Next scheduled maintenance?  
A: 30-Sep-2025  

### Advantages

* Captures complete information.
* Easy for less-trained staff.
* Reduces reporting errors.
